Hello, I'm Johan "Palmen" Palmfjord ðŸ‘‹ I like code and techno. However, this website is mostly about code and things related.

Within coding, I specialize in full-stack development with React, Node and Java/Kotlin - and deploying cloud-native apps with IaC on Kubernetes, in e.g. AWS. But I tend to stay curious, so this tech is likely to change as I and the world develop further.

You can of course find the source code for this website at [github.com/palmenhq/palmenhq.dev](https://github.com/palmenhq/palmenhq.dev).

## Company

I run the consultancy firm PalmenHQ AB (org. no. 559399-4568/BG 5947-4445). If you'd be interested in contractor services, feel free to shoot me an email at [johan@palmenhq.dev](mailto:johan@palmenhq.dev).
